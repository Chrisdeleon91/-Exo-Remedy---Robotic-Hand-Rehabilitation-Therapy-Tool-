# Exo-Remedy-Robotic-Hand-Rehabilitation-Therapy-Tool
Led a team of 4 engineers through from specification development to the product development cycle, design, planning and execution, engineering design, benchtop and field test and evaluation. Led 3D modifications of hand, mechanics, ergonomics, assembly, C++ testing and implementation.
Integrated an Arduino Uno microcontroller into a mixed-signal circuit with use of linear actuators, motor controllers, force sensors and flex sensors. 


Exo-Remedy is a tool to use for hand therapy, a patient can soothe or even perform complete therapy advised by their doctor right at home. Then, the results of their therapy are relayed to their doctor.
